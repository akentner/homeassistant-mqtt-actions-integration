# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-28)

**Core value:** A state change on one MQTT-backed device reliably triggers the configured actions on every connected HA instance, each executing them locally.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Walking Skeleton: Installable Switch

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Walking Skeleton: Installable Switch)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-29 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 44/44 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Research's 5 phases compressed to 4 (coarse granularity); scaffold/CI/foundation merged into the Switch walking skeleton (vertical MVP slice)
- [Roadmap]: Trust gate ships in the same phase as follower apply (Phase 3); no release with follower apply before it
- [Roadmap]: Startup policy = baseline only (opt-in run-on-startup flag); command topic equals state topic; domain `mqtt_actions`; min HA 2026.9.0
- [Roadmap]: OPS-06 test tiers are built incrementally per phase (TDD on) and closed in Phase 4 when the multi-instance tier exists

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Confirm haos-op3050-1, lxc-haos-104 and hassio-n2plus can all run HA 2026.9.0 (Python 3.14) before fixing the `hacs.json` floor
- [Phase 1]: Spike needed: `ActionSelector` rendering and field-level validation inside a subentry flow (LOW confidence); verify local brand icon path against current HACS docs
- [Phase 2]: Spike needed: generated Select `value_template`/`command_template` with escaping, tested against a real HA MQTT discovery run
- [Phase 3]: Needs deeper research before planning (`/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 3`): prune strategy (grace window vs owner manifest), `FakeBroker` design, Repairs approval flow, discovered-entity registry cleanup, subentry deletion hooks, subentries as device store fit
- [Phase 3]: Open decision: owner availability (heartbeat + graceful-shutdown publish vs. no tie to owner liveness); AVL-01 is deferred to v2
